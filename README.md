# React Homepage

A website designed from scratch using react and react-bootstrap to showcase the first projects I created as a developer back in 2019 as part of the University of Texas at Austin's Coding Boot Camp summer cohort. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
``
### Setting Up

You can create a react-app using [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

Once you set up the application, install the required packages by running:
```
yarn add react-bootstrap
```
```
yarn add react-dom
```
```
yarn add react-router-dom
```
```
yarn add react-strap
```

```
yarn add react-scroll
```
## Deployment

To run the application, run:

    yarn start
